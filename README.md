# cancer-diagnostic-tool
A cancer diagnostic tool for all types of cancer 
 This simplified  example assumes you have access to patient data and a trained machine learning model for each type of cancer (e.g., lung, breast, skin).
Key Features of the Code:
    Input Data Collection: Collects patient information and test results.
    Model Selection: Dynamically loads appropriate pre-trained models based on the cancer type.
    Prediction and Risk Assessment: Uses models to evaluate the likelihood of cancer and provide a risk score.
    Result Interpretation: Provides actionable results for further medical evaluation.
NOTES
    1. Model Training: This example assumes you have already trained and saved models using libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch. Training would involve datasets specific to each cancer type.
    2. Data Input: Features must match the input format expected by each model (e.g., biomarker levels, imaging data).
    3. Scalability: Extend the MODEL_PATHS dictionary and add more models for additional cancer types.
    4. Ethics and Validation: Any diagnostic tool must undergo rigorous validation, clinical trials, and ethical reviews before deployment in a real-world setting.
    5. Enhancements: Consider adding graphical user interfaces (GUI) or APIs for better accessibility.
